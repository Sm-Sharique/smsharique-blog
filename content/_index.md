Hi Agniva Mahata here.

I'm an explorer & life-long learner of tech and human interaction. I've spent 5+ years in Tech & Startups, worked with a bunch of places from startups in India to working with German NGO in Africa, at present I run few companies:
- [CashCowLabs](https://cashcowlabs.io), a organic Growth agency for Saas.
- [Ganjes](https://www.ganjes.net/), a Venture Capital firm.

My journey spans AI/ML, business, and innovation.

I build bold ideas, chasing the impossible :D
