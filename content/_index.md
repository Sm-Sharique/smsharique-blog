Hi,

Agniva Mahata here. Based in India, I'm an explorer at heart, life-long learner of tech and human behaviour. I've 5+ years of experience in Tech & Startups, run few companies like [CashCowLabs](https://cashcowlabs.io), a growth firm for Saas, and [Ganjes](https://www.ganjes.net/), a Web3 venture capital firm. My journey spans AI/ML, business, and innovation.

I build bold ideas, chasing the impossible :D
