I've always been drawn to ideas that challenge my thinking. This page is my digital antilibrary - a collection of links that have shaped who I am and how I see the world.

Some you might know, others might be new. They're the videos, podcasts, and reports I find myself revisiting time and again. I'm no expert, just a curious explorer sharing what's caught my attention. Dive in, pick something intriguing, and let it spark your imagination.

Who knows? It might just change your perspective, as it did mine.
